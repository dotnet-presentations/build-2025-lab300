# LAB300 - Hands-on with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio 2026

This lab will guide you through using GitHub Copilot's various features in Visual Studio 2026. You'll start with a partially completed TinyShop application and use GitHub Copilot to complete missing features and enhance the application.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2026 with GitHub Copilot extension installed
- .NET 10 SDK
- GitHub account with Copilot subscription (including Free)

## Lab Overview

The TinyShop application consists of two main projects:
