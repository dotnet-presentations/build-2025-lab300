Now, you'll improve the loading experience using Copilot's inline chat.

1. Open `Products.razor` in the Store project.
2. Find the "Loading..." text in the code.
3. Select this text and right-click.
4. Choose "Copilot > Start inline chat" or press `Alt+/`.
5. In the inline chat, type: "Replace this with a loading progress spinner."
6. Preview the suggestion by clicking the "Preview" button.
7. Accept the change by clicking "Accept."
8. Run the application to see your new loading spinner in action.
