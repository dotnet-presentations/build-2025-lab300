1. [] Type: `#ProductService.cs` to reference the ProductService file.
1. [] Ask: `How would I implement getting and visualizing the products in a table using the code in #ProductService and the css required.`
1. [] Review the code suggestion but don't implement it yet.
1. [] Notice how Copilot can reference existing code to provide contextual suggestions.

**Key Takeaway**: Referencing files in your chat provides Copilot with the context it needs to give more accurate, project-specific suggestions.
