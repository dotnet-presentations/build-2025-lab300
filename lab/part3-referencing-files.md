# Part 3: Referencing Code Files in Chat

In this section, you'll learn how to reference existing code files in your chat conversations.

1. Open `Products.razor` from the Store project.
2. Open Copilot Chat (press `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3. Type: "@ProductService" to reference the ProductService file.
4. Ask: "How would I implement getting and visualizing the products in a table using the code in ProductService?"
5. Review the code suggestion but don't implement it yet.
6. Follow up with: "How would this look in a grid instead of a list?"
7. Notice how Copilot can reference existing code to provide contextual suggestions.

**Key Takeaway**: Referencing files in your chat provides Copilot with the context it needs to give more accurate, project-specific suggestions.
