# Part 3: Referencing Code Files in Chat

In this section, you'll learn how to reference existing code files in your chat conversations.

1. [] Open **Products.razor** from the Store project.
2. [] Click on the Github Copilot Chat in the top-right corner of Visual Studio and select **Open Chat Window** or press `Ctrl+\+C` if Copilot chat isn't open.

3. [] Type: `#ProductService.cs` to reference the ProductService file.
4. [] Ask: `How would I implement getting and visualizing the products in a table using the code in ProductService?`
5. [] Review the code suggestion but don't implement it yet.
6. [] Follow up with: `How would this look in a grid instead of a list?`
7. [] Notice how Copilot can reference existing code to provide contextual suggestions.

**Key Takeaway**: Referencing files in your chat provides Copilot with the context it needs to give more accurate, project-specific suggestions.
