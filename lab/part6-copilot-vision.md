2. [] Open a new Copilot Chat edits thread.
3. [] Click the **+** button in the chat and select the store application image that is found in the GitHub repo that is cloned called **eShop.png** inside of the **C:\Users\LabUser\Source\Repos\build-2025-lab300** directory.

4. [] Ask: `Update the Products.razor to display products in a grid layout similar to this image. Add nice hover effects and make it responsive.`
5. [] Review the suggested code changes and implement them. It should recommend changes to both the **Products.razor** and a new **Products.razor.css**
6. [] Run the application to see the updated product grid layout.

> Note: continue to iterate with Copilot edits if it isn't to your liking.

**Key Takeaway**: Copilot Vision can understand UI designs from images and help you implement them in your application.
