# Part 6: Using Copilot Vision

In this final section, you'll use Copilot Vision to implement a UI design from an image.

1. Find the store application image on your desktop.
2. Open a Copilot Edits chat (press `Ctrl+Shift+E`).
3. Click the "Attach Image" button and select the store application image.
4. Ask: "Update the Products.razor to display products in a grid layout similar to this image. Add nice hover effects and make it responsive."
5. Review the suggested code changes and implement them.
6. Run the application to see the updated product grid layout.

**Key Takeaway**: Copilot Vision can understand UI designs from images and help you implement them in your application.
